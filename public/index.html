      content="Strong communicator with a knack for mobilizing teams and translating technical concepts into plain English (or terrible Spanish). Able to quickly implement new technologies. I live for solving complex problems and learning new things. I don't know how to do everything, but I know how to find out how to do anything. And Iâ€™ll always make the coffee."
